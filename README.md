# Password generator

## This application enables the user to generate random passwords depending on the selections they make when prompted.

- By creating this password generator the user is able to create a password, which is the end goal.
- This project takes the guessing game out of creating a password and simply gives it to the user.
- In this project I learned how to take everything that was thought this last week and put it all into one project. By doing this I am able to see how certain activities learned could be used in every day life.
